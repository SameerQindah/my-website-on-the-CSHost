This assignment involves the creation of some HTML pages. You are forbidden to use any 
HTML code generator tools for this assignment.  
This individual assignment consists of three tasks:  
1. Structure the folder of your website on the CSHost 
2. Create your home page 
3. Create a Community of practice website.  
Your HTML file should include: 
• The basic components of an HTML file: file type, head, title, body 
• Headers of different size 
• Paragraphs of text 
• An image without a link and <figure> element 
• An image that links out to another page 
• A hyperlink that is represented as text. 
• list 
• Table 
• Semantic tags  
• Form

1. Structure your website folder. 
You need to take some steps to structure your web folder effectively. Start by logging onto 
the hosting server and opening the " public_html." Then, upload your home page file to the 
folder so it will be accessible to the public. 
After that, create three new folders in the "public_html "ass", "examples", and "project." In 
each of these folders, make a new file called "index.html," which will be the default web 
page displayed when visitors browse each folder. 
To further organize your content, create a subfolder in each of the three main folders, with a 
number assigned to it. For instance, within the "ass" folder, create a subfolder named 
"ass1." Inside "ass1," create a file called "index.html." Repeat this process for the other two 
folders, ensuring the subfolders and files are appropriately named. 
Additionally, inside the "examples" folder, make a subfolder called "htmlEx." Upload the 
HTML examples discussed in the lecture, then make an "index.html" file to refer to the 
examples. 
By following these steps, you'll have a well-structured and easy-to-navigate web folder, 
making it simple for visitors to locate what they're looking for. 
You have provided full details on setting up your domain on the CS host on the last page.

4. Community of practice for a website: 
You are required to develop a website for a collaborative community of practice for a web 
programming course that facilitates students' collaboration and knowledge sharing. A 
community of practice is a group of individuals who share a common interest or profession 
and come together to learn from each other, share knowledge and experiences, and solve 
problems. A collaborative community of practice can be created using a web application or 
website that allows members to interact with each other and share information and 
resources. 
A collaborative community of practice website can have several features that allow 
members to interact, share knowledge and experiences, and collaborate with each other. 
Some of the system features of a collaborative community of practice website are: 
User profiles: User profiles allow members to create a profile that includes their name, 
photo, and brief bio. This feature can help members learn about each other and find people 
with similar interests and expertise. 
Knowledge base: A knowledge base is a database of information and resources members 
can access. This feature can be useful for members who want to learn about a topic or find 
answers to common questions. Article creation: The knowledge base functionality should 
allow users to create and publish articles within the knowledge base. Articles should include 
titles, descriptions, body text, and relevant images or videos. 
File sharing: File sharing allows members to upload and download files such as documents, 
images, and videos. This feature can be helpful for members who want to share resources, 
templates, or examples of best practices. 
Search functionality: Search functionality allows members to search for specific topics, 
keywords, or members. This feature can help members find relevant discussions, 
resources, and experts. The search functionality should have a search bar should allow 
users to enter keywords, phrases, or topics they want to search for. 
The task  
a) Create a home page for your community of practice, and provide a unique name, 
objectives, logo, and navigation to the four functionalities above. The home page 
should provide information about the community of practice. This information 
promotes the community to potential users, so you must introduce them in terms of 
community objectives and services. You are required to include text information and 
pictures or other graphics. You must only use the HTML techniques discussed in 
class and chapters 3 and 5 of the textbook. Make sure you use a truly fictitious name 
for the community -- one that no one else uses (check the web). Save the home page 
in filename index.html and store it within a sub-folder named “ass1”. Then, add a 
link to the Assignment One index file on your home page. 
4 
b) Provide four static HTML pages that incorporate forms to implement the user 
interface of the above functionality. You must use the right form controls, such as text 
input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns. Use the HTML5 form 
validation attributes to validate form input and ensure data accuracy. Also, you must 
consider accessibility when designing HTML forms by using descriptive labels, 
providing alternative text for form controls, and making forms keyboard accessible. 
c) You must upload all the task files, HTML documents, and other resources, such as 
image files, to the “ass1” folder. 
d) All forms should be submitted to the following PHP script using “post” method, 
http://yhassouneh.studentprojects.ritaj.ps/util/process.php 
e) A Contact Us page: this page should provide information on how the community 
moderators could be contacted. You should give the correspondence address, 
telephone number, email, and a contact form containing the following details: 
Sender Name, Sender E-mail, Sender Location (city), Message Subject, Message 
Body, and send and reset buttons. 

General Requirements for all pages: 
• All the pages must consist of the following parts: 
• Header: Contains the logo, site title, and navigation links. 
• Main Section: Displays information related to the page’s functionality. 
• Footer: Displays community contact information (address, telephone number, 
email) and copyright.
